# Holberton School Shell Project

This is a shell project designed for Holberton School, covering various aspects of shell scripting and Unix systems.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into several sub-projects, each focused on specific aspects of shell scripting:

### Basics

In the "Basics" sub-project, you will learn and implement fundamental concepts related to shell scripting. This includes:

- Understanding the command-line interface.
- Creating and executing basic shell scripts.
- Working with variables and environment variables.
- Basic control structures (if statements, loops, etc.).
- Scripting best practices.

### Init Files, Variables, and Expansions

The "Init Files, Variables, and Expansions" sub-project delves deeper into advanced scripting concepts. Here, you will explore:

- Init files, such as `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`, and how they affect the shell environment.
- Variable types, including environment variables, local variables, and shell variables.
- Variable expansions and parameter substitutions.
- Customizing shell prompt and aliases.
- Executing scripts on shell initialization.

### I/O Redirections and Filters

In the "I/O Redirections and Filters" section, you will learn how to manipulate input and output streams, including:

- Redirection of standard input and output streams (stdin, stdout, stderr).
- Creating and using pipelines for data manipulation.
- Applying filters and commands like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and `cut`.
- Combining filters and redirection for complex data processing tasks.
- Handling standard file descriptors in shell scripts.

### Permissions

The "Permissions" sub-project focuses on managing file permissions and security in Unix-based systems. You will learn about:

- File ownership and permissions (user, group, and others).
- Using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands.
- Special permissions, such as the setuid, setgid, and sticky bit.
- Access control lists (ACLs) for fine-grained control.
- File attributes, including immutable and append-only flags.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the specific sub-project you want to work on (e.g., "basics," "init_files_variables_and_expansions," "io_redirections_and_filters," or "permissions").
3. Follow the instructions provided in each sub-project's README for detailed guidance on tasks and assignments.
